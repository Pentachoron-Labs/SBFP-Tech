[size=18pt]I. Description[/size]
With all those other tech mods, it's all the same. Mine some ore, smelt it, use it to build wire, connect the wire to all of your machines. Not SBFP-Tech! We want to keep in the spirit of Minecraft, by veering just a little from reality. We don't use wire; instead the entire system is based on "Redstone Flux", an energy that can be stored in redstone and used by any machine. Also, tractors.
