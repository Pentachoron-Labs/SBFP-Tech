Coding Guidelines
=================
Use the branch *master* for quick bufixes and such. Create a branch with a *very* descriptive name for developing new features, such as "orefix" for fixing ore generation.

Commit at the end of every work session, so if you break something, you can go back to it and idiots don't do commits on your branch and overwrite your changes.

Just don't be stupid in general. I don't like stupid people.
