Wouldn't *you* like to know!

If you don't, well, you *should*.

I mean it.

What does SBFP do?

Nothing. (At least, not *now*)

Coding Guidelines
=================
Use the branch *master* to develop new features if you are not ObsequiousNewt. If you have an already-developed feature that you break just before a release, create a branch so you don't interfere massively with other people merging their branches into master for release.

Commit at the end of every work session, so if you break something, you can go back to it and idiots don't do commits on your branch and overwrite your changes.

Just don't be stupid in general. I don't like stupid people.
